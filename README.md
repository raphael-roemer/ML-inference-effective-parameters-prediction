# MLE-inference-effective-parameters-prediction

This is the code for my Master's thesis 'Frequency dynamics in power grids:
Inference of effective parameters and prediction using machine learning'. 

In the folder "MLE" you will find all code that was used in the thesis for the maximum likelihood estimation.

The code of machine learning and SHAP values is in the folder "ML" and is mostly taken from https://github.com/johkruse/XAI-for-grid-frequency-stability.git
